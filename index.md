### Specul8
**Specul8** is a spatial geometry sonification technique that aims to create meaningful sonic representations of the 3D environment by mapping parameters of first-order light reflections to various parameters of sound synthesis engines.

Much like echolocation, specul8 relies on information from first-order reflections from the surrounding geometry to create spatial understanding of the environment. 

Unlike echolocation though, specul8 creates continuous explorative soundscapes which encode information about the geometry of the environment. 

The original project was developed in fulfillment of my MMus in Sonology degree in 2006. It used [OGRE](https://www.ogre3d.org) graphics rendering engine and [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io) sound synthesis language.

Currently it is being re-built, replacing OGRE with [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc) toolkit.


### Applications
Specul8 can be potentially useful in following applications:

- as a tool for studies of cross-modal perception
- as an auditory aid to help navigate virtual (and digitised real) spaces for partially-sighed or blind users
- as an interactive compositional tool for creating "sonic augmented reality" experiences

Further research on this project focusses on:
- invetigation of various parameter mapping strategies and their perceptual, cognitive and aesthetic properties
- application of machine learning techniques to parameter mapping across audio-visual domains
- feasibility of using LIDAR data to apply this technique to physical spaces
