## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Specul8 is a spatial geometry sonification technique that aims to create meaningful sonic images from interpreting information about first-order reflection.

Much like echolocation, specul8 relies on information from first-order reflections from the surrounding geometry to create spatial understanding of the environment. 

Unlike echolocation though, specul8 creates continuous explorative soundscapes which encode information about the geometry of the objects present in the environment. 

The original project was developed in fulfillment of my MMus in Sonology degree in 2006. It used [OGRE](https://www.ogre3d.org) graphics rendering engine and [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io) sound synthesis language.

Currently it is being re-built replacing OGRE with [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc) toolkit.

Specul8 can be potentially useful in following applications:
- as a tool for studies of cross-modal perception
- as an auditory aid to help navigate virtual (and digitised real) spaces for partially-sighed or blind users
- as an interactive compositional tool for creating "sonic augmented reality" experiences

Further research on this project focusses on:
- invetigation of various parameter mapping strategies and their perceptual, cognitive and aesthetic properties
- application of machine learning techniques to parameter mapping across audio-visual domains
- feasibility of using LIDAR data to apply this technique to physical spaces

Some basic video demos 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/s8/specul8/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/s8/specul8/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
